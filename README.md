# Beer App Backend - Strapi

I used headless CMS Strapi to create backend for my Beer App

There are couple of steps you will need to follow to make sure your Starpi connected.

Run

`npm i`

#after

`npm run develop`
 

After Strapi is done installing, you will be directed to  http://localhost:1337/admin 

Sign in

You will need to grant Strapi access to Beer App

Navigate to : `User & Permissions Plugin`  ->` Roles `-> `Public ( role ) ` -> `Permissions` - `Application` -> `Select All`   -> `Save`

This should allow Strapi access to your front end application ->Now you should be ready to start adding beer on your front end  http://localhost:3000/


Enjoy
